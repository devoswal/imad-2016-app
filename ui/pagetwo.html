<p title = "mere baare me" style ="font-family:courier;text-align:center;border: 1px solid white; padding:20px;margin:20px;" >Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <b>standard dummy </b>text ever<strong> since the 1500s</strong>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also <i>This text is italic</i> the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <mark>Marked</mark> <del>blue</del> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
